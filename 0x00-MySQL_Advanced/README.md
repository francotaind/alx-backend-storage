## Introduction

## Database Optimization
Database optimization is the process of making a database perform better. This
can involve a number of different tasks, such as optimizing queries, indexing
tables, and tuning the database server. Database optimization is important

Transactions and Locking
Transactions are a way to ensure that a series of SQL statements are executed
together as a single unit of work. This is important when you have a series of
statements that must be executed together, and you want to ensure that they are
all executed or none are executed. For example, consider a bank transfer. You
want to ensure that the money is removed from one account and added to another
account. If the money is removed from one account but not added to the other
account, then the bank is in trouble. Transactions ensure that both statements
are executed together, or neither is executed.
Advanced data types and Management
SQL has a number of advanced data types that can be used to store complex
database objects. These include arrays, JSON, and XML. In addition, SQL has a
number of advanced management features that can be used to manage then
database. These include triggers, stored procedures, and views.
Advanced SQL Queries
SQL has a number of advanced query features that can be used to retrieve
database data. These include subqueries, joins, and unions. In addition, SQL has
a number of advanced query functions that can be used to manipulate data. These
include aggregate functions, window functions, and recursive queries.
